# java_lab8 


Lab exercise implemented for the course Object Oriented Programming(HY 325) during my 1st year studying at the University of Thessaly. 
We were tasked to create a card game using Java that allows the user to play a game, where he guesses if the next card drawn from the deck will be higher, lower or equal to the current one.
